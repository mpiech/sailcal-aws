# sailcal

Example OpenShift Clojure+JavaScript+SQL+Mongo app with calendar of sailboat reservations and tracks of past voyages. Frontend is JavaScript single-page app (SPA) with two main divs: a calendar based on Fullcalendar.io and a map based on Google Maps. Calendar shows history and future of dates on which sailboat is reserved based on data scren-scraped from reservation website. Calendar also shows past datess for which track data is available. Clicking a date with "Track" indicated causes map div to display track. Works with companion utilities 'sailrsv' to get reservation data and 'sailtrk' to get track data.
